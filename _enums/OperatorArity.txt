unary                              // Unary operator. Mutually exclusive with `ternary` and `nAry` flags. Can be combined with `binary`.
binary                             // Binary operator. Mutually exclusive with `ternary` and `nAry` flags. Can be combined with `unary`.
ternary                            // Ternary operator. Mutually exclusive with other arity flags.
nAry                               // N-arity. Mutually exclusive with other arity flags.
